✈️ Airline Route Performance Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
This project analyzes the performance of domestic U.S. airline routes using a simulated dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal was to explore how different routes perform across key metrics—like revenue, load factor, aircraft type, and customer acquisition—and use those insights to recommend improvements in airline strategy.

🎯 Project Goal
To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that mirrors real-world airline analytics, similar to what a Revenue Management or Network Planning Analyst might create. The dashboard helps visualize route profitability, operational efficiency, and customer trends to support strategic decision-making.

🔁 Workflow
Data Sourcing: Used a Kaggle dataset as the base for simulating 30 days of flight activity across 8 domestic U.S. routes, including fields like fare, aircraft type, seats sold, and new customers.

Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured the dataset in Excel using pivot tables and calculated fields to summarize revenue, load factor, and customer trends.

Visualization in Power BI:

KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Avg Load Factor, New Customers

Charts: Bar charts, line charts, and column charts for route-level performance

Slicers: Enabled dynamic filtering by route, aircraft, and date

🧠 What I Learned
Gained hands-on experience simulating and analyzing real-world airline KPIs such as Load Factor, Revenue, and Customer Acquisition.

Learned how to structure a dashboard that provides actionable insights using clean layout, interactive slicers, and visual storytelling.

Strengthened my skills in Power BI, Excel, and data visualization best practices.

Developed a deeper understanding of the metrics and decisions behind airline performance and capacity planning.

📊 Key Insights
High-revenue routes didn't always have the highest load factors, indicating potential overcapacity or pricing issues.

Some smaller aircraft achieved better utilization on certain routes, highlighting opportunities for better fleet-to-route alignment.

Customer acquisition trends showed weekly spikes, suggesting targeted promotions could better align with demand surges.

💡 Recommendations for Revenue Growth
Reevaluate pricing strategies or flight frequency on underperforming high-revenue routes.

Optimize aircraft deployment on routes with consistently high load factors.

Launch marketing initiatives during periods of high new customer activity to boost retention and revenue.

📈 Impact
This project demonstrates how aviation data can drive smarter decisions in pricing, scheduling, and customer strategy. It showcases my ability to work with real-world airline metrics and present insights through a clean, interactive dashboard.
